Since Igor PRO v6 and v7 limits the maximum number of characters used to name a wave or variable many abreviations needed to be used.
In this file I want to introduce the nameing principles I used and list the long names for the abreviations used.

First and foremost I leant all names on the way the programmers from Asylum Research did it with their code. 
Every raw data wave and also all processed waves follow the principle of BASENAME followed by a short abreviation indicating the TYPE of data stored and SUFFIX to state whether the approach, retraction or dwell was recorded.
