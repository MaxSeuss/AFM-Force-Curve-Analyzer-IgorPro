Since Igor PRO v6 and v7 limits the maximum number of characters used to name a wave or variable many abreviations needed to be used.
In this file I want to introduce the nameing principles I used and list the long names for the abreviations used.

First and foremost I leant all names on the way the programmers from Asylum Research did it with their code. 
Every raw data wave and also all processed waves follow the principle of BASENAME followed by a short abreviation indicating the TYPE of data stored and SUFFIX to state whether the approach, retraction or dwell was recorded.  

BasenameType_Suffix

Used Suffixe are:
_ext for extension or approach == the way towards the sample; sometimes shorten to "_tr"
_ret for retraction == the way away from the sample; sometimes shorten to "_re"
_towd for towards which corresponds to the part of the curve while in dwell on or away from the surface

Used Types of curves:
- Raw measurement data and general input waves
  DeflV refering to deflection singal in Volts from the photodiode
  Raw refering to the piezo movement in z direction in m
  ZSnsr refering to the ZSnsr movement in z direction in m
  BOTH Raw and ZSnsr are treated equally in this code. At least one needs to be there
  
- Calculated Types of curves
  Defor refers to Deformation calculated concering the point of contact found
  Force refers to the calculated force based on DeflV * inverse optical lever sensitivity * spring constant
  Sepa refers to tip sample separation also based on the contact point determined.

- Calculated Types storeing results from a given routine
  Cont refers to Contact Point determination
  AdhF refers to Adhesion Force storing the "standard" adhesion force and point value
  AdhV refers to Adhesion Voltage storing the "standard" adhesion voltage and point value
  AdhFJKR refers to Adhesion Force determined by Johnson-Kendall-Roberts theory
  AdhFDMT refers to Adhesion Force determined by Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov theory
  Maugis refers to all the input and fitting variables used to calculate the Maugis fit in the Carpick approxmiation
  MD_D* and MD_F* refer to purely calculated waves for Force and Deformation while performing the Maugis fitting
  ContRad refers to the Contact Radius calculated purely from geometric consideration to be used in the Maugis fitting
  WoAdhF refers to the Work of Adhesion (Force) calculated based on JKR or DMT model
  
There are further Types of curves used but for them I refer the User to look up the specifics in the comments of the source code.
